# calcTest
Simple Calculator Program:
- add
- subtract
- multiply 
- divide

Calculator Possible Enhancements:
- square/ exponential
- square root / logs 
- graphing?
- UI intergration?
- (This may not get implemented but its good to think of what the future may have)

## Requirements 
1. Read [Test Driven Development Section](##test-driven-development-(tdd))
2. Create Tests for Calculator in CalculatorTest.java (Check with Jordan before starting on Calculator.java)
3. Implement Calculator.java, then run tests to verify it is working correctly. 
4. Simple Example of how test Driven Development Works!! Completed! 

## Test Driven Development (TDD)
test driven development, TDD, is a software development process that uses a cycle to develop code in a managable way. 
```
TDD Cycle:
- Add a test (initially failing)
- Write some code
- Run tests
- refactor code
- repeat
```

By Doing this a developer is able to manage code easier. when a change happens that breaks code the tests will show sections of the code that were affected. 

Test-driven development is not about testing. Test-driven development is about development (and design), specifically improving the quality and design of code. The resulting unit tests are just an extremely useful by-product.
