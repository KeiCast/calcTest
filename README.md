## Test Driven Development (TDD)
test driven development, TDD, is a software development process that uses a cycle to develop code in a managable way. 
```
TDD Cycle:
- Add a test (initially failing)
- Write some code
- Run tests
- refactor code
- repeat
```

By Doing this a developer is able to manage code easier. when a change happens that breaks code the tests will show sections of the code that were affected. 

Test-driven development is not about testing. Test-driven development is about development (and design), specifically improving the quality and design of code. The resulting unit tests are just an extremely useful by-product.
